OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and scalable SQL-based system to manage student academic records, including grades, GPA, and CGPA, using MySQL Workbench.

TOOLS USED:
MySQL Workbench â€“ for database creation, querying, and management

DATA BASE DESIGN
1. Database
A dedicated database named result_processing_system was created to manage and organize all academic data.

2. Tables
Students: Stores student personal and academic details like name, department, batch, and email.

Courses: Contains course-specific data such as name, credits, and semester offered.

Semesters: Tracks semester-wise academic details for each student.

Grades: Holds the marks, grade letters, and grade points earned by students in various courses across semesters.

DATA ENTRY:
Sample data was inserted into each table to simulate a real academic environment.

Grades include mappings of students to their course performance along with numeric and letter grades.

KEY FEATURES AND QUERIES:
ðŸ”¹ GPA Calculation (Per Semester)
A view was created to calculate the GPA for each student for every semester.

GPA is computed using the formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
GPA = SUM(grade_point Ã— course_credits) / SUM(course_credits)
ðŸ”¹ CGPA Calculation (Cumulative)
A query was used to calculate the CGPA for each student across all semesters.

CGPA uses the same weighted average logic as GPA but spans all semesters.

OUTPUT REPORTS
GPA View: Displays each student's semester-wise GPA.

CGPA Summary: Provides an overall CGPA for every student in the database.

ADDITIONAL FUNCTONALITIES:
Trigger-based automatic GPA update on grade insert.

Procedures for bulk result uploads.

Grade distribution analytics per course.

Semester-wise pass/fail report.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
All tables are normalized to avoid data redundancy.

Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity between tables.

The system is easily scalable to accommodate additional departments, courses, or grading schemes.
